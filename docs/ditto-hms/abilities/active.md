## Ability details

### Water Gun
**Hunger:** 1 · **Cooldown:** 2s · **Power:** radius 3

Fires in the direction you're looking — extinguishes fire, wets sponges, and places a water block on the aimed surface.

---

### Leafage
**Hunger:** 1 · **Cooldown:** 2s · **Power:** radius 5

Instantly grows **every crop around you** to full maturity — handy for fast harvests.

---

### Cut
**Hunger:** 2 · **Cooldown:** none · **Power:** max 128 blocks

Treecapitator (BFS). Aim at a **log** → cut all connected logs (+ attached leaves); aim at a **leaf** → strip connected leaves. Drops match a Netherite Axe.

---

### Rock Smash
**Hunger:** 2 · **Cooldown:** none · **Power:** max 32 ores

Instantly breaks the block you aim at. If it's an **ore**, vein-mines all connected ore of that type; otherwise breaks the single pickaxe-minable block (Netherite Pickaxe drops).

---

### Rototiller
**Hunger:** 1 · **Cooldown:** none

Tills the dirt-type block you're aiming at into Farmland (Dirt, Grass Block, Coarse Dirt, Dirt Path).

---

### Camouflage
**Hunger:** 3 · **Cooldown:** 10s · **Power:** 6000t (**5 minutes**)

Disguise yourself as the **living creature** you're looking at:

- Aim at an **entity** in clear view → an inert copy of that creature (matching its
  variant/equipment) is spawned over you and mirrors your movement, so you actually *look* like
  that mob to everyone. Your own skin is hidden so it doesn't bleed through the disguise.
- A block, a wall between you and the target, or empty air → nothing happens (you can only copy a
  creature you can actually see).

Lasts 5 minutes or until you use it again. *(Morphing onto another player falls back to a
name-tag + size match, since players can't be cloned.)*

---

### Stockpile
**Hunger:** 1 · **Cooldown:** 1s · **Power:** lava self-damage 2

Drinks up the **water or lava** block you aim at (source or flowing) — handy for draining pools or
clearing a path. Water is free; **lava is spicy** and singes you for a little health each gulp.

---

### Strength
**Hunger:** 2 · **Cooldown:** none

Pushes the aimed block one block in your horizontal facing direction. Won't move fluids or container blocks.

---

### Waterfall
**Hunger:** 2 · **Cooldown:** 6s · **Power:** 40t

**While in water**, rides a strong upward current toward the surface. Must be in water to use.

---

### Magnet Rise
**Hunger:** 2 · **Cooldown:** 10s · **Power:** 100t (5s)

**Airborne-only** — you must be off the ground to use it. Grants **Levitation II + Slow Falling** for 5 seconds, letting you gain and hold height mid-air like a Magnezone. Using it on the ground does nothing.

---

### Ember
**Hunger:** 1 · **Cooldown:** 1s · **Power:** reach 5 blocks

Works like **Flint & Steel** — places fire, primes TNT, and ignites entities in front of you.

---

### Bullet Seed
**Hunger:** 2 · **Cooldown:** 1s · **Power:** 5 seeds per burst

Fires a rapid barrage of seed projectiles, consuming any `"seed"` items from your inventory. Direction is locked at activation.

---

### Teleport
**Hunger:** 5 · **Cooldown:** 5s · **Power:** max 30 blocks

Blinks you to the block you're looking at (≤ 30 blocks), finding the nearest safe landing. Plays the Enderman teleport sound.

---

### Fly
**Hunger:** 3 · **Cooldown:** 1s · **Power:** 1200t

Launches you skyward and engages **Glide** — ride the skies like a Charizard. Re-use it in the
air for a firework-style boost.

!!! note "Requires Glide"
    You must have **learned Glide** to use Fly. Using Fly automatically turns the Glide toggle on.
    It does **not** give or equip an Elytra item.

---

### Rain Dance
**Hunger:** 5 · **Cooldown:** 10s · **Power:** 6000t (5 min)

Summons **rain** on the overworld.

---

---

### Explosion

---

### Defog
**Hunger:** 2 · **Cooldown:** 5s · **Power:** 10

Cures **your own negative status effects** (poison, wither, blindness, slowness, mining fatigue, weakness, hunger, unluck, levitation), leaving you fresh.

---

### Crabhammer
**Hunger:** 3 · **Cooldown:** 2s

A heavy mace swing: deals strong damage and knocks back all enemies within 3 blocks in front of you.

---

### Revival Blessing
**Hunger:** 1 · **Cooldown:** 20 min

Fully heals and **revives every Pokémon in your party** — clears faints and status. Drains **all** your hunger as the cost.

---

### Charm
**Hunger:** 2 · **Cooldown:** 3s · **Power:** 2400t (**2 minutes**)

Aim at a mob and use it — that mob becomes **charmed** and follows you around for 2 minutes (it paths toward you when more than ~3 blocks away). Great for relocating a stubborn animal or keeping an ally close.
